        <!-- Story 1: Snow Birthday -->
        <article class="story">
            <h2>Snow Birthday</h2>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>I turned thirty-seven on a Tuesday in April, which has always felt like the least interesting time to have a birthday. Not winter, not quite spring. Where I grew up, April meant gray skies and cold rain, a damp in-between season I'd never learned to love.</p>

                <p>My sister had a December birthday. There were always strings of lights, the smell of pine, an atmosphere of anticipation that had nothing to do with her specifically but that she got to borrow anyway. My brother's birthday fell in July, all chlorine and popsicles and staying up late because there was no school to worry about. Mine came in the gap between tax day and Mother's Day, a blank spot on the calendar.</p>

                <p>I woke up that Tuesday in Colorado—I'd been here eight months—and opened the curtains to snow. Not a dusting. Real snow, the kind that meant something, covering the deck rail in a thick line, mounding on the propane tank, making the junipers look like they were wearing coats.</p>

                <p>I stood there in my socks and watched a few flakes drift upward, rising instead of falling, just for a moment before they remembered which way snow was supposed to go.</p>

                <p>The snow wasn't for me, obviously. Weather doesn't care about birthdays. But it arrived anyway, on this particular April Tuesday, and I was here to see it.</p>

                <p>I made coffee and watched it fall. Big flakes, the unhurried kind. I thought about my sister's December birthdays, how she'd never asked for the lights and the pine smell, how they just came with the season. I'd always thought of that as luck.</p>

                <p>But maybe it wasn't about the season at all. Maybe it was about noticing what showed up.</p>

                <p>I'd spent thirty-six years thinking April was empty. Squeezed between winter and summer, between drama and ease. Now I was watching snow fall in a place where snow in April isn't particularly surprising, but it surprised me anyway.</p>

                <p>I didn't make a cake. I didn't call anyone. I put on boots and a coat and walked up the road, just to the first bend where you can see down into the canyon. Everything was white and quiet. My footprints were the only ones.</p>

                <p>There's a kind of play that has nothing to do with games or laughter. It's lighter than that. It's stepping into snow for no reason except that it's there. It's turning thirty-seven and feeling, for the first time, that April might be exactly the right month for a birthday after all.</p>

                <p>When I got back to the house, the snow was already starting to melt. By evening it would be gone. But that morning it was mine, in the way that anything can be yours if you notice it arriving.</p>

        <!-- Story 2: First Birthday in the Canyon -->
        <article class="story">
            <h2>First Birthday in the Canyon</h2>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>The baby turned one on a Saturday in June, and Maya had invited the neighbors without really knowing who would come.</p>

                <p>She'd made a cake—vanilla with buttercream, nothing fancy—and set up a folding table in the yard. There were balloons tied to the mailbox, bright against the pale canyon dirt. Her husband, Tom, had mowed a patch of scrub grass into something that could almost pass for a lawn.</p>

                <p>Three kids showed up. Two were siblings, maybe nine and eleven, who lived a quarter mile down the road. The third was a teenager, maybe fifteen, who'd been walking past and got redirected by his mother. None of them knew the baby. The baby didn't know them. But they came, and they stood around the cake with a politeness that felt almost formal.</p>

                <p>The baby sat in a high chair borrowed from someone Maya had met once at the post office. She smashed her hands into the cake, which was what babies were supposed to do, and the kids watched like it was a performance they'd agreed to attend.</p>

                <p>The nine-year-old asked if there were any games.</p>

                <p>Maya hadn't thought about games. The baby couldn't play games. But she found a soccer ball in the garage, and the kids kicked it around in the scrubby yard while Tom cut slices of cake that the adults ate standing up.</p>

                <p>One of the balloons pulled free from the mailbox. They all watched it rise, higher than balloons usually go, past the tops of the ponderosas, past where it should have stopped, until it was just a red dot against the blue, and then nothing at all.</p>

                <p>The neighbors talked about the road—whether the county would grade it before monsoon season, whether the washout near the cattle guard was getting worse. Maya half-listened. She watched her daughter, who had frosting in her hair and no idea this was supposed to be special.</p>

                <p>The fifteen-year-old came over and crouched next to the high chair. He made a goofy face, and the baby laughed, a real belly laugh that surprised everyone.</p>

                <p>"She's cool," he said, and went back to kicking the soccer ball with the younger kids.</p>

                <p>An hour later, everyone was gone. Maya and Tom sat on the deck while the baby napped inside, cake smashed into the carpet that would need scrubbing later.</p>

                <p>"That was nice," Tom said.</p>

                <p>Maya nodded. It had been nice. Not the party she'd imagined when they lived in town—no trampoline park, no coordinated theme, no friends from daycare. Just neighbors who didn't really know them yet, standing around eating cake because that's what you do when someone invites you.</p>

                <p>The baby wouldn't remember this. But Maya would. The way the canyon light hit the junipers at four in the afternoon. The sound of kids laughing over a soccer ball. The red balloon that kept going. The beginning of something, even if she couldn't say exactly what.</p>

        <!-- Story 3: Baxter's Nineteenth Birthday -->
        <article class="story">
            <h2>Baxter's Nineteenth Birthday</h2>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Baxter woke up slowly, the way he did everything now. His back legs took a moment to remember their job. He stood in the kitchen, blinking at the morning light, while Sarah scrambled eggs at the stove.</p>

                <p>She'd given him an extra piece of bacon. He ate it without ceremony, then looked at her as if to confirm this was real and not some mistake that would be corrected.</p>

                <p>"Happy birthday, old man," she said.</p>

                <p>Baxter had been nineteen for about six hours, if you counted from midnight, which Sarah did. Nineteen was old for a dog, especially a mutt who'd spent his first years running loose in the canyon, chasing things he never caught, eating God knows what.</p>

                <p>She clipped the leash to his collar, though he didn't really need it anymore. He stayed close now, his wandering days behind him.</p>

                <p>They walked up the hill behind the house. It wasn't much of a hill, but it took them fifteen minutes to reach the top, Baxter stopping every few yards to sniff or rest or just stand there, his breath coming heavier than it used to.</p>

                <p>At the top, Sarah sat on a flat rock. Baxter lay down beside her, his chin on his paws.</p>

                <p>She looked at the canyon spreading out below them—the scrub oak, the scattered houses, the road cutting through like a vein. She'd walked this hill a hundred times with Baxter. A thousand, maybe. When he was young, he'd run ahead, disappearing into the trees and circling back, his whole body vibrating with energy.</p>

                <p>Now he just lay there, content.</p>

                <p>There were rocks nearby, granite pieces smoothed by weather. Sarah noticed them without meaning to—three flat stones that could be stacked, could mark a spot if you needed to mark one. When she touched the top stone, it was warm, though the sun hadn't reached this part of the hill yet.</p>

                <p>She didn't stack them. Not today.</p>

                <p>Baxter sighed, a long, comfortable sound. His tail thumped once against the dirt.</p>

                <p>For just a moment, he seemed to remember something from before—not before Sarah, but before Baxter, if such a thing were possible. A different hillside, or the same hillside in a different time. The memory passed through him like wind, and then he was just Baxter again, old and tired and here.</p>

                <p>Sarah scratched behind his ears, the spot he'd always liked best. His fur was thin there now, the skin loose and soft.</p>

                <p>"Nineteen," she said aloud.</p>

                <p>Baxter closed his eyes.</p>

                <p>They stayed on the hill for a while, longer than they needed to. When they finally walked back down, Baxter moved slowly but steadily, his body remembering the way even if his legs didn't quite believe it.</p>

                <p>At home, he drank water and collapsed on his bed by the wood stove. Sarah sat on the floor beside him, her hand resting on his side, feeling the rise and fall of his breathing.</p>

                <p>She didn't know if there would be a twentieth birthday. But there had been a nineteenth, and they'd walked up the hill together, and that was enough for now.</p>
